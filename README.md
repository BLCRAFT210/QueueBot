# QueueBot
This Queuebot can be invited to your server and set up.

# What is this?
Queuebot is originally a Discord bot created and programmed by Cynda (insert link to Cynda's Github). After a squad queue is started, players form their own teams and queue as a team. Once there are enough teams, a server administrator will close the squad queue and make the rooms. This means that all of the teams in the queue will be matched against other teams in the squad queue with similar ratings. The Discord text channels are automatically created with each the teams that have been paired. Once everyone has finished playing their matches, a server administrator can end the squad queue, which will delete all of the created text channels.

# This sounds neat! So what's the point of this Github repository?
While Cynda's original Queuebot was a fantastic idea, there were limitations. For example, Queuebot couldn't be invited to other servers. Anyone that wanted to have a Queuebot had to download the code and run their own bot for their server. Additionally, if the way you ran your server's ratings were a bit different, you'd have to make modifications to the code. Bad Wolf saw an opportunity to generalize the bot to allow any server to add it. He added many powerful customization features and enhancements, including visual customizations, the ability to set up your own rating system (or none at all), scheduling squad queues to run automatically, and even customizations that affect the squad queue itself.

For more information on all of the customizations and settings server administrators have the ability to change, run the commands **!help**, **!rating_help**, and **!queuebot_settings_help**.

# Does anyone use it?
Yep. To date, 16 servers have added this Queuebot. And to my knowledge, at least 3 of them use it on a frequent basis for a large server. Mario Kart Wii Lounge, MK7 Lounge, and MKT Lounge are 3 servers that I know use this bot for their squad queues.

# Okay, how do I get the bot?
